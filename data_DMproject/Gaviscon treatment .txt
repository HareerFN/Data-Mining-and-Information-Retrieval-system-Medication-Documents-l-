Gaviscon treatment 
Gaviscon is an over-the-counter medication used to relieve symptoms associated with acid reflux, heartburn, and indigestion. It belongs to a class of medications known as antacids, which work by neutralizing stomach acid and forming a protective barrier in the stomach to prevent acid from flowing back into the esophagus. Gaviscon is available in various formulations, including liquid suspension and chewable tablets, and may contain active ingredients such as aluminum hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, or sodium bicarbonate.
Gaviscon should not be used in individuals with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of its components. It is also contraindicated in patients with severe kidney disease, hypercalcemia (high levels of calcium in the blood), or alkalosis (high pH levels in the blood). Additionally, Gaviscon should be used with caution in patients with heart failure, hypertension, or edema (fluid retention), as it may contain ingredients that can exacerbate these conditions.Gaviscon is typically taken orally and can be consumed as a liquid suspension or chewable tablet. It is important to follow the dosage instructions provided on the packaging or as directed by a healthcare professional.
