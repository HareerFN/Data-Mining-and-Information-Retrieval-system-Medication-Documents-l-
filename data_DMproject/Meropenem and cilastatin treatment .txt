Meropenem and cilastatin treatment 
Meropenem and cilastatin is a combination medication used to treat severe bacterial infections. It contains two active ingredients: meropenem, a carbapenem antibiotic, and cilastatin, a renal dehydropeptidase inhibitor. Meropenem works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death. Cilastatin prevents the breakdown of meropenem in the kidneys, allowing for higher concentrations of meropenem to remain in the body for longer periods.Meropenem and cilastatin should not be used in individuals with a known allergy or hypersensitivity to any of its components, including meropenem, cilastatin, or other carbapenem antibiotics. It is also contraindicated in patients with a history of severe allergic reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins or cephalosporins.Meropenem and cilastatin is typically administered intravenously in a hospital or healthcare setting. It should not be taken orally or injected into the muscle. The dosage and administration of meropenem and cilastatin are determined by a healthcare professional based on the type and severity of the infection, as well as individual patient factors such as weight, age, and renal function.Meropenem and cilastatin is generally safe for adults and children of all ages, including newborns and infants. However, dosage and administration should be adjusted based on age, weight, and renal function.
